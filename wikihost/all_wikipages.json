He uses the metaphor of a \"false summit\" while hiking to illustrate the continuous nature of problem-solving. Hank explains, \"when you are hiking up a mountain, there's this thing called a false summit, where you look ahead and you see what looks like the top of the mountain. But then when you get there, you realize that, in fact, it was the whole time, like, a slight rise that was occluding the actual summit from your view.\"<ref name='cvpB8JVG6_E'>[What I learned from the weirdest day of my life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvpB8JVG6_E) - Uploaded on 2024-10-02</ref> This analogy highlights the ongoing nature of challenges and the importance of perseverance in overcoming them.\n\n== Struggles with Multi-Faceted Identity ==\nIn \"My Identity Crisis,\" Hank Green candidly discusses his struggle with maintaining a coherent personal identity amidst his diverse interests and roles. He acknowledges the difficulty of sticking to a singular identity in the age of personal branding, stating, \"I cannot decide who I am. And in the world of the personal brand, it is good to find a person who you are and stick to it.\"<ref name='d-I1OldpvUE'>[My Identity Crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-I1OldpvUE) - Uploaded on 2024-07-12</ref> Hank elaborates on his various personas, from \"science guy\" to \"sock guy,\" and the challenges these pose to his personal brand and those who work with him.

He argues that \"constraint is inspiring,\" explaining how limitations can \"really juice up the creative process.\"<ref name='3d6vqlLM3Hw'>[I ain't she was with well and I so and it's and but so and I'll and](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6vqlLM3Hw) - Uploaded on 2020-10-02</ref> Hank shares his experience of using constraints, such as limiting YouTube video titles to words from a specific song, to foster creativity and innovation. This approach not only challenges conventional strategies but also aligns with their broader goal of not prioritizing channel growth over creative exploration.\n\n== Emphasize Productivity Through 80% Completion ==\nHank Green shares his productivity philosophy in \"The Secret to my Productivity,\" advocating for the completion of projects to 80% rather than striving for perfection. He explains, \"Everything creative I do, I do my best to get it 80% of the way to as good as I can make it, and go no further.\"<ref name='1LAhHDEtTD0'>[The Secret to my Productivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LAhHDEtTD0) - Uploaded on 2017-10-27</ref> This approach recognizes the diminishing returns of perfectionism and the importance of releasing work into the world to learn and grow. Hank emphasizes that the pursuit of an unattainable \"best\" can hinder progress and that embracing imperfection can lead to greater productivity and creativity.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Hank Green]]\n* [[John Green]]\n* [[Vlogbrothers]]\n* [[Personal Branding]]\n* [[Creativity]]\n\n== External Links ==\n* [Vlogbrothers YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/vlogbrothers)\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Vlogbrothers-related topics]]\n[[Category:Philosophy]]\n[[Category:Creativity]]\n[[Category:Productivity]]",

John Green, in particular, has stressed that how one uses fame matters greatly.

This observation underscores the idea that fame is not always a reflection of merit or talent, but rather a societal choice.\n\n== Creating for Joy, Not Fame ==\nIn \"The Gift of Gary Busey,\" John Green encourages creating content for the joy it brings rather than for the pursuit of fame. This philosophy aligns with the Vlogbrothers' broader approach to content creation, where the focus is on meaningful engagement rather than widespread recognition<ref name='j22qA39eHvw'>[The Gift of Gary Busey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j22qA39eHvw) - Uploaded on 2009-08-26</ref>.\n\n== Gratitude for Community Recognition ==\nHank Green, in the video \"August 15: Getting Featured on YouTube,\" expresses gratitude for the recognition received from the YouTube community. He acknowledges that while fame is subjective, being appreciated by a community of \"cool people\" is more rewarding than universal fame<ref name='3lysboGhQ5g'>[August 15: Getting Featured on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lysboGhQ5g) - Uploaded on 2007-08-16</ref>.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[John Green]]\n* [[Hank Green]]\n* [[Vlogbrothers]]\n* [[YouTube]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Vlogbrothers-related topics]]\n[[Category:YouTube]]\n[[Category:Education]]",

Over the years, he has shared his experiences and reflections on the impact of these platforms on society and individual well-being. This article delves into Hank's journey with TikTok, his critique of algorithms, and his personal experiences with nature as a means of emerging from depression.\n\n== TikTok Journey and Impact ==\nHank Green began his TikTok journey almost four years ago, with his initial videos gaining significant traction. His fourth TikTok, in particular, received millions of views, which coincided with the release of his book and his interest in content platforms and their cultures<ref name='V6Lz97pkIBc'>[Do I Regret TikTok?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6Lz97pkIBc) - Uploaded on 2024-09-20</ref>. Despite the success, Hank expressed mixed feelings about his involvement with TikTok, acknowledging both the positive and negative aspects of the platform.\n\nHank appreciated TikTok for its role as a \"culture factory,\" filled with art, experiments, and storytelling. He discovered many talented comedians, artists, musicians, and science communicators through the platform<ref name='V6Lz97pkIBc' />. However, he also recognized the darker side of TikTok, particularly the influence of artificial intelligence algorithms on content creation and consumption. Hank noted that these algorithms often prioritize content that can capture attention through fear, controversy, and drama, which can have detrimental effects on mental health and societal cohesion<ref name='V6Lz97pkIBc' />.\n\n== Critique of Algorithms ==\nHank Green has been vocal about the societal impact of algorithms, particularly in how they shape beliefs and emotions. He observed that algorithms, in collaboration with media and creators, work to keep users engaged on platforms, often at the cost of mental health and social harmony<ref name='V6Lz97pkIBc' />. Hank highlighted that almost half of Gen Z wishes TikTok had never been invented, reflecting broader concerns about the platform's influence<ref name='V6Lz97pkIBc' />.\n\nIn another video, Hank discussed how algorithms decide what people think about and how they feel, often exploiting individual vulnerabilities<ref name='C2TWRzH7MCY'>[My Consciousness. Their Capital.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2TWRzH7MCY) - Uploaded on 2024-09-17</ref>. He shared his personal experience of emerging from depression by reducing his engagement with algorithms and spending more time in nature. This shift allowed him to regain some control over his emotions and thoughts, highlighting the profound influence algorithms can have on mental health<ref name='C2TWRzH7MCY' />.\n\n== Emerging from Depression Through Nature ==\nHank Green's journey through depression involved a conscious effort to disconnect from algorithm-driven platforms and reconnect with the natural world. He described experiences such as fishing and walking in the woods, which provided a sense of calm and relief from the overwhelming sadness he felt<ref name='C2TWRzH7MCY' />. These activities allowed him to focus on the sensations of the natural world, such as the wind on his skin and the sound of blue jays, which helped lift his spirits<ref name='C2TWRzH7MCY' />.\n\nHank's encounter with a coyote during one of his walks illustrated the unpredictability of emotions in both the digital and natural worlds. The sudden appearance of the coyote triggered a surge of panic, akin to the intense emotions elicited by algorithm-driven content. This experience underscored the parallels between the natural world's influence on emotions and the manipulative nature of algorithms<ref name='C2TWRzH7MCY' />.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Hank Green]]\n* [[Vlogbrothers]]\n* [[TikTok]]\n* [[Algorithms]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Vlogbrothers-related topics]]\n[[Category:Social Media]]\n[[Category:Mental Health]]",

He notes, \"Illness is not some moral narrative and conceiving of it that way is yet another barrier to empathy\"<ref name='2IwPysNwt-s'>[Empathy and its Limits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IwPysNwt-s) - Uploaded on 2023-02-28</ref>.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[John Green]]\n* [[Hank Green]]\n* [[Vlogbrothers]]\n* [[Empathy]]\n* [[Stress management]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Vlogbrothers-related topics]]\n[[Category:Health]]\n[[Category:Emotions]]",

This conversation underscores a fundamental desire in physics to find a cohesive explanation for the universe's forces.\n\n== IceCube Observatory and Neutrino Mapping ==\nHank Green has also discussed the IceCube Observatory, a significant project in the realm of astrophysics. In \"The Biggest Weirdest Telescope We've Ever Built,\" he describes the IceCube Observatory as a unique neutrino detector located in Antarctica. The observatory detects neutrinos by observing the faint flashes of light they produce when colliding with atomic nuclei<ref name='rt7BEhUBdcE'>[The Biggest Weirdest Telescope We've Ever Built](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rt7BEhUBdcE) - Uploaded on 2023-07-21</ref>. This innovative approach enables scientists to study neutrinos, which are notoriously difficult to detect due to their weak interactions with matter.\n\n=== Mapping the Galaxy with Neutrinos ===\nThe IceCube Observatory's capabilities extend beyond neutrino detection. Hank Green explains that the observatory is used to create a map of the galaxy using neutrino collisions. This method does not rely on photons, offering a novel way to visualize the galaxy<ref name='rt7BEhUBdcE' />. Although the current map is of low resolution, advancements in machine learning are expected to enhance its clarity over time. This development represents a significant step forward in astronomical mapping techniques.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[John Green]]\n* [[Hank Green]]\n* [[Vlogbrothers]]\n* [[Grand Unified Theory]]\n* [[IceCube Neutrino Observatory]]\n\n== External Links ==\n* [Vlogbrothers YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/vlogbrothers)\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Vlogbrothers-related topics]]\n[[Category:Physics]]\n[[Category:Astrophysics]]",
    "40": "= Art and Life in Vlogbrothers Videos =\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe Vlogbrothers, [[John Green]] and [[Hank Green]], have used their platform to explore various philosophical ideas and personal beliefs. Through their videos, they have discussed the importance of generosity in art, the continuity of life amidst loss, and the acknowledgment and celebration of happiness. These themes are intricately woven into their content, reflecting their perspectives on art, life, and human experience.\n\n== Art Requires Generosity and Open Attention ==\nIn the video titled \"A Secret about Art,\" John Green delves into the nature of art and its reception. He emphasizes that creating art requires \"all the generosity and openness you can muster,\" but it is equally dependent on the audience's willingness to engage with it generously<ref name='dx0RdCeS4Rk'>[A Secret about Art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx0RdCeS4Rk) - Uploaded on 2024-05-07</ref>. This belief underscores the collaborative nature of art, where both the creator and the audience play crucial roles. John illustrates this by noting that \"a generous reader can make a good book great, and an ungenerous reader can make a great book terrible\"<ref name='dx0RdCeS4Rk' />. This perspective is further exemplified by his reference to visual art, such as the Raymond Pettibon spiral painting featured in his novel \"Turtles All the Way Down.\"\n\n== Life Continues Even Through Loss ==\nThe theme of life's persistence despite loss is explored in John's review of \"Auld Lang Syne\" on his podcast, [[The Anthropocene Reviewed]]. He reflects on the song's association with New Year's Eve and its deeper implications about continuity and memory<ref name='Wgh8Gfs2S7M'>[John's Review of Auld Lang Syne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgh8Gfs2S7M) - Uploaded on 2023-12-30</ref>. In another episode of the podcast, John quotes [[Emily Dickinson]], stating, \"hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul,\" to convey the idea that life and love endure even as individuals do not<ref name='nGzeMNxqpYU'>[Auld Lang Syne: The Anthropocene Reviewed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGzeMNxqpYU) - Uploaded on 2020-12-31</ref>. These reflections highlight a recurring theme in John's work: the resilience of life and the enduring nature of human connections.\n\n== Acknowledge and Celebrate Happiness ==\nJohn Green also emphasizes the importance of recognizing and celebrating happiness in everyday life. In the video \"Some Advice,\" he shares a piece of advice from [[Kurt Vonnegut]]: \"I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, 'If this isn\u2019t nice, I don\u2019t know what is'\"<ref name='lqaRbnR8xUY'>[Some Advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqaRbnR8xUY) - Uploaded on 2022-09-06</ref>. John explains that acknowledging happiness prevents it from slipping by unnoticed, ensuring that joyful moments are celebrated rather than overshadowed by difficult times. This philosophy is exemplified by his habit of keeping a bottle of sparkling grape juice or champagne on hand to celebrate good news, no matter how small<ref name='lqaRbnR8xUY' />.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[John Green]]\n* [[Hank Green]]\n* [[The Anthropocene Reviewed]]\n* [[Turtles All the Way Down]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Vlogbrothers-related topics]]\n[[Category:Art]]\n[[Category:Philosophy]]\n[[Category:Happiness]]",

This candid admission highlights the complexity of human emotions and the challenge of dealing with uncertainty.\n\n== Expressing Love and Vulnerability ==\nHank Green has often spoken about the importance of expressing love and vulnerability. In the video \"Why is it So Hard to Say 'I Love You'?\", he discusses the difficulty many people face in expressing love, attributing it to the vulnerability it requires.

In a video titled \"Feeling Like a Failure (During an Eclipse),\" Hank reflects on the inevitability of natural phenomena like eclipses and contrasts them with human-created entities such as educational resources and charitable internet stores. He states, \"some things are inevitable, like eclipses, and some things are only there because of human choices\" <ref name='nunFf4hLQLo'>[Feeling Like a Failure (During an Eclipse)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nunFf4hLQLo) - Uploaded on 2024-04-12</ref>.\n\n=== Human Influence ===\nHank emphasizes the impact of human decisions on the existence of certain aspects of life. He mentions the creation of microscopy videos and free educational resources on platforms like YouTube, which are made possible through community support and funding. This perspective underscores the importance of recognizing the human agency in the existence of various societal constructs.\n\n== AI Image Scrutiny ==\nIn the video \"How to Detect AI Images (and why it doesn't matter),\" Hank Green discusses the necessity of scrutinizing AI-generated images. He suggests that such scrutiny may not always be essential, implying that the focus should be on more significant issues. Hank remarks, \"AI image scrutiny isn't always necessary\" <ref name='I8HAzNzfzaI'>[How to Detect AI Images (and why it doesn't matter)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8HAzNzfzaI) - Uploaded on 2024-01-12</ref>.\n\n=== Technological Impact ===\nHank's stance reflects a broader consideration of technology's role in society. While acknowledging the potential for AI to generate content, he seems to advocate for a balanced approach that does not overemphasize the need for scrutiny at the expense of addressing more pressing concerns.\n\n== Quality Over Quantity in Advanced Societies ==\nHank Green explores the philosophical evolution of advanced societies in his video \"Is it Good or Bad that we Haven't Met Aliens?\" He posits that such societies may prioritize quality over quantity, suggesting a shift in values as civilizations advance. Hank speculates, \"sufficiently advanced species... start to think more about quality than quantity\" <ref name='58qD2VzjBwI'>[Is it Good or Bad that we Haven't Met Aliens?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58qD2VzjBwI) - Uploaded on 2023-03-10</ref>.\n\n=== Philosophical Shift ===\nThis idea aligns with the notion that advanced civilizations might focus on sustainable growth and the enhancement of life quality rather than mere expansion.

This highlights the delicate balance platforms must achieve between allowing free expression and preventing the spread of harmful misinformation.\n\n== Users as Products ==\nThe concept of users being the product for sale on social media platforms has been a recurring theme in the Vlogbrothers' discussions. In the video \"You ARE The Product,\" John Green explained the Internet maxim that if a service is free, the users are the product being sold. He remarked, \"Facebook is worth a hundred billion dollars because... it's worth whatever it's worth because of you!\" <ref name='PtqlU_wT-oo'>[You ARE The Product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtqlU_wT-oo) - Uploaded on 2012-05-22</ref>.

In \"Who is in Control?\" Hank Green expressed apprehension about the implications of personalized news and the reliance on platforms like Facebook for information. He highlighted the potential risks associated with the extensive data collection practices of social media companies <ref name='8_942GMxf98'>[Who is in Control?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_942GMxf98) - Uploaded on 2018-04-13</ref>.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[John Green]]\n* [[Hank Green]]\n* [[Facebook]]\n* [[Social Media]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Vlogbrothers-related topics]]\n[[Category:Social Media]]\n[[Category:Truth and Misinformation]]",

Despite her passing at the age of 80, her influence continues to resonate within the community, particularly among [[Nerdfighteria]], the community founded by John and Hank Green.\n\n== Esther Day ==\nEsther Day is a holiday celebrated on August 3rd, dedicated to expressing love beyond romantic relationships. It was inspired by Esther Earl, a Nerdfighter who passed away from cancer in 2010 at the age of 16. Esther's wish was for her birthday to be a day where people express love to family and friends, rather than focusing solely on romantic love. This sentiment is captured in numerous Vlogbrothers videos, where both John and Hank Green emphasize the importance of this kind of love.\n\n=== Origins and Purpose ===\nThe idea for Esther Day originated from a conversation between John Green and Esther Earl. As Hank Green recounts, \"John asked Esther Earl... what she would like us as a community to do on her birthday. She said she wanted it to be a day to celebrate the kind of love that people have inside of families and friendships, not romantic love.\"<ref name='TFfzXA5c5fk'>[Happy Esther Day!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFfzXA5c5fk) - Uploaded on 2014-08-03</ref> This was further elaborated by Hank in a 2012 video, where he stated, \"Esther's message hit home harder than ever... she wanted it to be a day where we celebrated love between family members and friends.\"<ref name='oJCfXb4Ci9g'>[I Don't Understand My Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJCfXb4Ci9g) - Uploaded on 2012-08-03</ref>\n\n=== Celebrations and Reflections ===\nEvery year, the Vlogbrothers commemorate Esther Day by sharing personal reflections and encouraging their audience to express love to those they care about.

    "44": "= NaFaDoYBIMSCoM and Writing Milestones =\n\n== Introduction ==\nJohn Green, a prominent author and one-half of the [[Vlogbrothers]], has developed a unique approach to writing that diverges from the traditional National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo). This approach, known as NaFaDoYBIMSCoM (National Finish a Draft of Your Book, I Mean, Seriously, Come on. Month), has been instrumental in his writing process, particularly in the completion of drafts for his acclaimed novels such as [[The Fault in Our Stars]] and [[Paper Towns]]. Additionally, Green has set personal goals to maintain a steady writing pace, aiming to write 5,000 words monthly for his novels.\n\n== NaFaDoYBIMSCoM ==\nNaFaDoYBIMSCoM is an alternative writing initiative created by John Green in 2007. It serves as a personal challenge to complete a draft of a book, differing from NaNoWriMo's goal of writing a novel within a month. Green first introduced this concept at the onset of the [[Vlogbrothers]] channel, aiming to provide a more flexible framework for writers who, like himself, may find the traditional NaNoWriMo structure too rigid.\n\n=== Origins and Purpose ===\nThe inception of NaFaDoYBIMSCoM was driven by Green's recognition of his own writing style, which he describes as a \"wildly inefficient way of writing.\"<ref name='zDBjqRj_bVQ'>[NaFaDoYBIMSCoM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDBjqRj_bVQ) - Uploaded on 2023-11-07</ref> He acknowledges the importance of writing every day without the pressure of perfection, a philosophy that aligns with the ethos of NaNoWriMo but with an added emphasis on completing a draft. Green's initiative allows writers to focus on finishing their projects, regardless of the time it takes, thus alleviating the stress associated with daily word count goals.\n\n=== Impact on Green's Novels ===\nNaFaDoYBIMSCoM has played a significant role in Green's writing career. In November 2007, during his first attempt at NaFaDoYBIMSCoM, Green completed a draft of \"Paper Towns.\"<ref name='zDBjqRj_bVQ' /> This achievement marked a pivotal moment in his career, showcasing the effectiveness of his alternative writing month. Furthermore, in 2010, Green utilized the same approach to complete a draft of \"The Fault in Our Stars,\" a novel that would later become one of his most successful works.<ref name='zDBjqRj_bVQ' />\n\n== Writing Goals and Processes ==\nBeyond NaFaDoYBIMSCoM, John Green has set personal writing goals to maintain productivity and creativity. In 2019, he expressed his intention to write 5,000 words monthly for his novels, a goal that reflects his commitment to consistent writing practice.<ref name='c6pGSQcHQmU'>[How to Make Goals, Not Resolutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6pGSQcHQmU) - Uploaded on 2019-01-01</ref>\n\n=== Consistent Writing Practice ===\nGreen's approach to writing emphasizes the importance of setting achievable goals. By aiming to write 5,000 words each month, he ensures a steady progression in his projects without overwhelming himself. This method allows him to balance creativity with discipline, fostering an environment where ideas can flourish over time.\n\n=== Reflections on Writing Progress ===\nThroughout his career, Green has been candid about his writing journey. In a 2015 video, he shared his progress on a novel, revealing that he had reached the 50,000-word mark, a milestone often associated with NaNoWriMo.<ref name='fsIwQeUKo0U'>[How to Get Good at Everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsIwQeUKo0U) - Uploaded on 2015-06-26</ref> Despite this achievement, he acknowledged that the book was far from complete, highlighting the reality that many novels require more extensive development beyond initial drafts.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[John Green]]\n* [[The Fault in Our Stars]]\n* [[Paper Towns]]\n* [[National Novel Writing Month]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Vlogbrothers-related topics]]\n[[Category:Writing]]",

    "14": "= Art and Its Unexpected Wonders in the Lives of the Vlogbrothers =\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe Vlogbrothers, [[John Green]] and [[Hank Green]], have consistently expressed their deep appreciation for art and its impact on life. Through their various video uploads, they have shared personal experiences and beliefs about how art brings wonder in unexpected ways, the essential nature of art, and the beauty found in backstage workings. This article delves into their perspectives and experiences, particularly focusing on John Green's visits to art museums and Hank Green's fascination with the unseen aspects of art.\n\n== Art Brings Wonder in Unexpected Ways ==\nJohn Green has often articulated his belief that art can bring wonder in unexpected ways. This sentiment is captured in a video where he recounts a moment from 2003, before he and his wife Sarah were married. During this time, they were friends, and he visited her apartment where she showed him some of her recent paintings<ref name='CsTESA9y6PE'>[Is This Painting Upside Down?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsTESA9y6PE) - Uploaded on 2022-11-01</ref>. This encounter highlights how art can create unexpected connections and moments of wonder between individuals.\n\n=== Visits to the Louvre ===\nIn a video titled \"Has this artist ever seen a baby?\", John Green shares his experience visiting the [[Louvre]] with his spouse. This visit was not only a personal journey but also an exploration of art's impact on perception and understanding.

In a video from September 2019, he discusses this philosophy, emphasizing how art contributes to the richness and depth of human experience. He suggests that art is not merely an aesthetic pursuit but a fundamental aspect of living that enhances understanding and connection<ref name='St2NP-3saCw'>[Another Contender in the Room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St2NP-3saCw) - Uploaded on 2019-09-10</ref>.\n\n== Beauty in Backstage Workings ==\nHank Green, in his video \"Behind the Sides,\" reveals his fascination with the backstage workings of art and performance. He describes his appreciation for the hidden aspects of theater, such as the backstage areas of the McGlohan Theatre in Charlotte, North Carolina. Hank argues that the beauty of function is as compelling as the finished product, likening the intricacies of a car engine or a CPU to the aesthetic appeal of a car or a phone. This perspective underscores the idea that the process and effort behind art are as valuable as the art itself<ref name='DUMEmGUc7yc'>[Behind the Sides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUMEmGUc7yc) - Uploaded on 2017-10-13</ref>.\n\n== Ai Weiwei's Art Installation ==\nJohn Green's engagement with art extends to his discussions of significant art installations, such as Ai Weiwei's \"According to What?\" at the Indianapolis Museum of Art.

This installation, which follows Ai's career, exemplifies how art can provoke thought and inspire change, further reinforcing John's belief in the essential nature of art<ref name='nDwTjPsG4b0'>[Poetry Makes Nothing Happen: Thoughts on Ai Weiwei from the Indianapolis Museum of Art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDwTjPsG4b0) - Uploaded on 2013-05-21</ref>.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[John Green]]\n* [[Hank Green]]\n* [[Louvre]]\n* [[Ai Weiwei]]\n\n== External Links ==\n* [Vlogbrothers YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/vlogbrothers)\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Vlogbrothers-related topics]]\n[[Category:Art]]",
    "41": "= Vague Problems and Human Understanding =\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe Vlogbrothers, consisting of [[John Green]] and [[Hank Green]], have explored various philosophical and social issues through their YouTube channel. This article delves into their beliefs and opinions on the themes of human misunderstanding, curiosity, and the impact of thoughts and tools on society. Their perspectives are illustrated through specific instances from their videos, highlighting their unique approach to these complex topics.\n\n== Vague Problems and Misunderstanding ==\nHank Green has expressed the belief that vague problems can lead to human misunderstanding. In the video titled \"This 'Math Test' Changed How I See Humanity,\" Hank discusses how certain questions, despite their simplicity, can lead to diverse interpretations and debates. He states, \"if vague questions that are easy to argue about mislead us into imagining the world incorrectly, I think it\u2019s important to ask, WHY these questions are easy to argue about\" <ref name='lBJVyCYuu78'>[This \"Math Test\" Changed How I See Humanity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBJVyCYuu78) - Uploaded on 2022-10-21</ref>. This highlights the potential for vague problems to distort our understanding of the world, as they allow for multiple, often conflicting, interpretations.\n\n== Human Curiosity as a Superpower ==\nJohn Green, in his video \"Why Do Things Exist?\", emphasizes the role of human curiosity as a driving force behind our quest for knowledge. He describes this curiosity as a \"superpower,\" noting that humans have an inherent desire to understand the world, even when such understanding is not necessary for survival. He states, \"this urge to know, even if we don\u2019t necessarily need to know in order to survive is kind of the human superpower\" <ref name='WlgFE9MNav4'>[Why Do Things Exist?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlgFE9MNav4) - Uploaded on 2022-07-19</ref>. This perspective underscores the importance of curiosity in human development and progress.\n\n== Thoughts and Actions ==\nThe distinction between thoughts and actions is another significant theme explored by the Vlogbrothers. In the video \"Vlogbrothers REUNITED AT LAST,\" John Green discusses the idea that thoughts do not necessarily define actions. He explains, \"You can have a thought and understand that it\u2019s just a thought. That a thought is not an action\" <ref name='58nKkouII4g'>[Vlogbrothers REUNITED AT LAST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58nKkouII4g) - Uploaded on 2021-11-30</ref>. This belief reflects a nuanced understanding of human cognition, recognizing that while thoughts can be complex and multifaceted, they do not inherently dictate behavior.\n\n== Tools and Their Impact ==\nHank Green has also expressed a desire for tools that do not have negative impacts on society. In \"A Tool with No Blood on It,\" he reflects on the complexity of creating tools that are entirely free from harm. He quotes Maggie Nelson, saying, \"people right now have a deep hunger for a tool with no blood on it and I do, I do but I don't know that that exists\" <ref name='DuLuxNfeCn4'>[A Tool with No Blood on It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuLuxNfeCn4) - Uploaded on 2021-10-22</ref>. This statement highlights the challenges of innovation and the ethical considerations involved in developing new technologies.\n\n== Truth and Ideology ==\nThe importance of prioritizing truth over ideology is another recurring theme in the Vlogbrothers' content. In \"The Amazon isn't 'Burning' - It's Being Burned,\" Hank Green stresses the need to remain committed to truth, regardless of ideological affiliations. He asserts, \"it's why we need to call a lie a lie no matter who says it\" <ref name='zhESYHHbzsc'>[The Amazon isn't \"Burning\" - It's Being Burned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhESYHHbzsc) - Uploaded on 2019-08-23</ref>. This belief underscores the significance of truthfulness in public discourse and personal integrity.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[John Green]]\n* [[Hank Green]]\n* [[Vlogbrothers]]\n* [[YouTube]]\n\n== External Links ==\n* [Vlogbrothers YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/vlogbrothers)\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Vlogbrothers-related topics]]\n[[Category:Philosophy]]\n[[Category:Social Issues]]",

    "12": "= Visit to Crown Hill Cemetery =\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe visit to Crown Hill Cemetery by [[John Green]] and [[Hank Green]] serves as a reflective exploration of community history and the notion of greatness. This cemetery, located in Indianapolis, is renowned for its historical significance and the notable figures interred there, including several U.S. Vice Presidents. Through their visit, the Green brothers engage in a dialogue about the impact of historical circumstances on the perception of greatness and the collective shaping of community identity.\n\n== Crown Hill Cemetery Visit ==\nThe visit to Crown Hill Cemetery is a significant event for John and Hank Green, as it allows them to delve into the rich history of Indianapolis. John Green, who resides in Indiana, has often spoken about the cemetery, highlighting its status as \"America\u2019s greatest cemetery\" and noting its distinction of having \"the most vice presidents per square mile anywhere in the US\" <ref name='jY8xaYrDIC0'>[John and Hank at the Cemetery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY8xaYrDIC0) - Uploaded on 2021-12-03</ref>.\n\n=== Epitaph Hunting ===\nDuring their visit, John and Hank engage in epitaph hunting, a practice that involves reading and reflecting on the inscriptions found on tombstones. This activity underscores the importance of personal narratives in shaping historical memory. Hank suggests that even \"a few extra words onto your tombstone\" can add significant meaning, illustrating how individual stories contribute to the broader tapestry of history <ref name='jY8xaYrDIC0' />.\n\n== Community History and Identity ==\nJohn Green's reflections on the community history at Crown Hill Cemetery emphasize the interconnectedness of individual lives and the collective history of Indianapolis. He notes that while the cemetery is home to many dignitaries, it is the stories of ordinary individuals that truly define the city's character. John states, \"I think about how all these people and so many more built the place where I now live,\" highlighting the role of everyday citizens in shaping the community's identity <ref name='OVoqDpjN_Do'>[America's Capital of Dead Vice Presidents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVoqDpjN_Do) - Uploaded on 2020-12-15</ref>.\n\n=== The Role of Circumstance in Greatness ===\nThe notion that greatness is largely a matter of circumstance is a recurring theme in the Green brothers' discussions. Hank Green articulates this belief by comparing the historical significance of Florence during the Renaissance to the potential of any small community, such as Missoula, Montana, where he resides. He asserts that \"great people are everywhere all the time,\" but it is the cultural, historical, and economic forces that determine whether they are remembered by history <ref name='KGWDw9ZGXEk'>[The Myth of Greatness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGWDw9ZGXEk) - Uploaded on 2014-05-16</ref>.\n\n== Philosophical Reflections ==\nThe visit to Crown Hill Cemetery also prompts philosophical reflections on the nature of history and human choices.

    "39": "= Art and Consciousness in the Vlogbrothers' Philosophy =\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe Vlogbrothers, comprised of [[John Green]] and [[Hank Green]], have long used their platform to explore complex themes such as the role of art in navigating consciousness and existence, the importance of reading fiction, and the desire to consume meaningful content. Through their videos, they have shared insights into how these beliefs shape their understanding of the world and their personal philosophies.\n\n== Art as a Means to Navigate Consciousness and Existence ==\nIn the video titled \"Orbital Sunrise: The First Art Made in Space,\" John Green discusses the profound impact of art on his consciousness and existence. He reflects on the drawing by cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, which serves as a source of solace and reflection during times of despair and uncertainty. John states, \"For me, art is a kind of landing site in the wilderness. Art is where I go when I do not know where else to go. Through art, paradoxes of consciousness resolve for me. I see what I will never see. I know what I will never know. And I survive what I will not survive.\"<ref name='xKfvkE3Xf6M'>[Orbital Sunrise: The First Art Made in Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKfvkE3Xf6M) - Uploaded on 2021-11-16</ref> This highlights his belief in art's ability to provide a space for contemplation and understanding beyond the tangible world.\n\n=== Art and the Human Experience ===\nJohn's reflections on art also touch upon its role in connecting individuals to the broader human experience. By engaging with art, one can explore emotions and ideas that transcend personal limitations. This connection to art as a means of understanding is a recurring theme in the Vlogbrothers' content, emphasizing the importance of creative expression in making sense of life's complexities.\n\n== The Importance of Reading Fiction ==\nJohn Green has frequently expressed his belief in the importance of reading fiction. In the video \"Decathlons, Pretension, and the Weirdest Animal I've Met: It's Question Thursday,\" he articulates two primary reasons for this belief: consolation and the opportunity to escape one's own consciousness. He explains, \"Reading good fiction helps me feel unalone in like the deepest ways. It makes me feel like even my inexpressible fears and demons don\u2019t separate me from humanity.\"<ref name='A_6gEQ6Wj7U'>[Decathlons, Pretension, and the Weirdest Animal I've Met: It's Question Thursday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_6gEQ6Wj7U) - Uploaded on 2016-11-17</ref> This underscores fiction's power to foster empathy and understanding by allowing readers to inhabit other perspectives.\n\n=== Fiction as a Tool for Empathy ===\nThe ability of fiction to offer insights into diverse experiences is central to John's advocacy for reading. By stepping into the minds of characters, readers can gain a deeper appreciation for the complexities of human emotions and relationships. This empathetic engagement is seen as essential for personal growth and societal cohesion.\n\n== Desire for Meaningful Content ==\nHank Green, in the video \"Thoughts from Comic-Con (NO MORE CHEETO MEDIA!),\" expresses a desire to consume content that is substantial and thought-provoking, rather than superficial or trivial. He states, \"I wanna stop consuming cheeto media and focus on the things in this world that make me love them. That take up my brain and make me think for weeks afterward.\"<ref name='X8-S0q0Ljms'>[Thoughts from Comic-Con (NO MORE CHEETO MEDIA!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8-S0q0Ljms) - Uploaded on 2016-07-29</ref> This sentiment reflects a broader philosophy of seeking out media that enriches the mind and soul.\n\n=== The Impact of Meaningful Content ===\nHank's emphasis on meaningful content aligns with the Vlogbrothers' overall mission to create and promote media that inspires critical thinking and emotional engagement.

    "55": "= Challenges Stigma Around Mental Illness =\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe Vlogbrothers, John and Hank Green, have been influential in addressing the stigma surrounding mental illness through their YouTube channel. They have shared personal experiences and insights into mental health challenges, including anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and chronic illness. Their openness has contributed to broader discussions about mental health and societal perceptions.\n\n== Anxiety and Brain Disorders ==\nIn the video titled \"I'm Having a Lot of Feelings,\" John Green discusses his evolving understanding of anxiety. He reflects on how he once perceived his anxiety as a \"character weakness\" but has come to recognize it as part of a brain disorder<ref name='Wzfe1_UE7tA'>[I'm Having a Lot of Feelings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wzfe1_UE7tA) - Uploaded on 2019-10-15</ref>. This shift in perspective highlights the importance of viewing mental health issues through a medical lens rather than a moral one. John states, \"I understand my anxiety as part of a brain disorder that I have which isn't my fault,\" emphasizing the need to separate personal blame from mental health conditions.\n\n== Personal Experience with OCD ==\nJohn Green has also shared his personal experiences with OCD in the video \"What OCD Is Like (for Me).\" He clarifies that while he is not a psychologist, he believes in the importance of listening to experts on mental health matters<ref name='jNEUz9v5RYo'>[What OCD Is Like (for Me)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNEUz9v5RYo) - Uploaded on 2017-07-25</ref>. By discussing his OCD, John contributes to destigmatizing the condition and encourages others to seek professional help.\n\n== Chronic Illness and Societal Perceptions ==\nIn the video \"Your Illness is Not Your Fault,\" John Green addresses the societal perceptions surrounding chronic illness. He shares his experiences living with ulcerative colitis and the frustration of hearing unsolicited advice that implies his illness is his fault<ref name='3krVl6UMIeo'>[Your Illness is Not Your Fault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3krVl6UMIeo) - Uploaded on 2016-07-08</ref>. John notes, \"when you tell me, a person who has lived with ulcerative colitis for more than a decade, that you have the secret to my wellness,\" it underscores the societal tendency to blame individuals for their health conditions.\n\n== Mental Illness and Personal Reflections ==\nThroughout their videos, the Vlogbrothers have been candid about their mental health struggles. In \"On Mental Illness (and the end of Pizzamas),\" John shares his experiences with mental illness, contributing to a broader understanding and acceptance of these issues<ref name='Z_y4CACK-9g'>[On Mental Illness (and the end of Pizzamas)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_y4CACK-9g) - Uploaded on 2015-11-20</ref>.

    "32": "= The Power of Gratitude and Complacency in John Green's Philosophy =\n\n== Introduction ==\n[[John Green]], an acclaimed author and one half of the [[Vlogbrothers]], often explores themes of gratitude, effort, and complacency in his vlogs. Through his reflections, Green shares his belief in the power of gratitude, his frustrations with perceived futile efforts, and how despair can lead to complacency. These themes are prevalent in his video content, offering insights into his personal philosophy and worldview.\n\n== The Power of Gratitude ==\nJohn Green frequently emphasizes the importance of gratitude in his life. In the video \"We Could All Use a Little Change,\" Green discusses how keeping a gratitude journal has significantly altered his perception of life. He states, \"I've been doing this for the last few months... and it really has changed the way I feel about human life\" <ref name='C6txQ5yn5S8'>[We Could All Use a Little Change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6txQ5yn5S8) - Uploaded on 2020-05-12</ref>. This practice encourages him to actively seek out moments of joy and appreciation throughout his day, such as observing a great horned owl with his daughter, Alice.\n\nGreen's belief in gratitude aligns with psychological studies that suggest savoring positive experiences can enhance well-being. In \"Savoring: The Sunset Series Returns,\" he reflects on the importance of taking time to appreciate simple wonders, like sunsets, which he describes as \"the one daily phenomenon that for me anyway, never gets old\" <ref name='t48Rx82HmCU'>[Savoring: The Sunset Series Returns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t48Rx82HmCU) - Uploaded on 2021-07-27</ref>. This practice of savoring requires \"slow time, thick time,\" allowing individuals to fully experience and appreciate the gradual unfolding of good news.\n\n== Frustration with Futile Efforts ==\nDespite his focus on gratitude, Green also expresses frustration with what he perceives as futile efforts. In \"The Thing with Feathers,\" he candidly shares his feelings about the challenges of creative work, stating, \"I've worked so much on stories that I eventually had to abandon and that's painful because you want work that you put into the world to have been for something\" <ref name='E17mQvkzmCc'>[The Thing with Feathers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E17mQvkzmCc) - Uploaded on 2019-04-30</ref>. This sentiment highlights the emotional toll of investing time and energy into projects that do not come to fruition.\n\nGreen's reflection on effort suggests a broader philosophical inquiry into the nature of work and its value. He questions the traditional conception of effort, proposing that the journey itself may hold intrinsic value, regardless of the outcome. This perspective encourages a reevaluation of success and failure, emphasizing the process over the product.\n\n== Despair and Complacency ==\nGreen also explores the relationship between despair and complacency. In \"Sawdust Bread,\" he discusses how despair can lead to a sense of complacency, stating, \"despair mostly just makes me complacent, like 'Oh there's nothing to be done about this horror or that horror. It's just the nature of things'\" <ref name='vjZarG7DOpc'>[Sawdust Bread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjZarG7DOpc) - Uploaded on 2018-02-06</ref>. This acknowledgment of despair's paralyzing effect underscores the importance of maintaining hope and motivation in the face of challenges.\n\nConversely, Green warns against the complacency that can arise from believing in inevitable progress. He notes that feeling assured of positive outcomes can lead to inaction, as individuals may rely on external forces to address global issues. This dual perspective on complacency highlights the delicate balance between hope and action, urging individuals to remain engaged and proactive in their efforts.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[John Green]]\n* [[Vlogbrothers]]\n* [[Gratitude]]\n* [[Complacency]]\n\n== External Links ==\n* [Vlogbrothers YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/vlogbrothers)\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Vlogbrothers-related topics]]\n[[Category:Philosophy]]",

Green has expressed disappointment over the inability to regain control of the rights and the numerous failed attempts to bring the story to the screen<ref name='xHfYj48mDCY' />. This experience contrasts sharply with the positive experiences he had with \"The Fault in Our Stars\" and \"Paper Towns.\"\n\n=== Reflections on Unrealized Hopes ===\nGreen has also reflected on the unrealized hope of seeing his collaborative work \"Let It Snow\" adapted into a movie.

This led to a reimagining of the story, yet he continued to face difficulties in bringing the project to completion.\n\n=== Pressure and Expectations ===\nGreen has spoken candidly about the pressure he felt following the success of \"The Fault in Our Stars.\" The transition from being a \"person who writes books\" to a \"person who wrote that one book\" was a significant source of stress<ref name='MiX7fVkTbzM' />. This pressure was compounded by the ongoing success of his previous work and the expectations for his future projects.\n\n== Unexpected Reach of His Work ==\nIn a surprising turn of events, Green discovered that his novel \"Paper Towns\" was read by the notorious figure El Chapo during his imprisonment<ref name='-_xq-JdBNak'>[El Chapo and Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xq-JdBNak) - Uploaded on 2016-07-26</ref>.

    "37": "= Stories and Writing in Vlogbrothers' Lives =\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe Vlogbrothers, [[John Green]] and [[Hank Green]], have long emphasized the profound impact of stories on our understanding of the world. Through their YouTube channel, they explore themes such as the role of narratives in shaping identity, the importance of practice in writing, and the limitations of novels in solving real-world problems. Their discussions often reflect their personal beliefs and experiences as writers and educators.\n\n== The Role of Stories ==\nStories are central to how we perceive and interpret the world around us. In a video titled \"How We Teach: Individualist Stories,\" Hank Green discusses the tendency to frame stories of great accomplishment as tales of individual genius rather than collective progress. He argues that \"the stories we tell aren\u2019t just tools with which to learn things, they are the thing we are learning.\"<ref name='srVVqWTJHE8'>[How We Teach: Individualist Stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srVVqWTJHE8) - Uploaded on 2020-11-13</ref> This belief underscores the idea that narratives shape our understanding of human achievements and responsibilities.\n\n=== Identity and Feedback ===\nIn another exploration of storytelling, Hank Green examines how identity is constructed through both positive and negative feedback. He notes that our brains are designed to create a narrative of self, where negative feedback plays a crucial role in shaping a more nuanced self-perception.<ref name='aU3zW0KDB5U'>[When to Attack a Moose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU3zW0KDB5U) - Uploaded on 2018-05-04</ref> This perspective highlights the importance of stories in forming personal identity and understanding one's place in the world.\n\n== The Craft of Writing ==\nThe Vlogbrothers also delve into the craft of writing, emphasizing the importance of practice and revision.

In \"Going Home with Alaska and Miles,\" John Green reflects on his experience with his first novel, \"Looking for Alaska,\" stating that \"novels do not solve problems or heal wounds.\"<ref name='15e66tOIvvI'>[Going Home with Alaska and Miles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15e66tOIvvI) - Uploaded on 2019-03-12</ref> This admission highlights a realistic understanding of the role of fiction in society, where stories can illuminate truths but not necessarily provide solutions.\n\n== Memory and Narrative ==\nThe Vlogbrothers also explore the nature of memory, emphasizing its narrative quality over accuracy. In \"Poopy Nintendo Mystery SOLVED WITH SCIENCE,\" John Green discusses how the brain is adept at storing narrative memories rather than precise ones.<ref name='QyXVTLoR1lI'>[Poopy Nintendo Mystery SOLVED WITH SCIENCE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyXVTLoR1lI) - Uploaded on 2010-06-30</ref> This insight aligns with their broader exploration of how stories shape human understanding and memory.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[John Green]]\n* [[Hank Green]]\n* [[Vlogbrothers]]\n* [[Narrative Identity]]\n* [[Writing Process]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Vlogbrothers-related topics]]\n[[Category:Writing]]\n[[Category:Storytelling]]",

    "57": "= The Fault in Our Stars Movie Adaptation =\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe adaptation of [[John Green|John Green's]] novel, ''[[The Fault in Our Stars]]'', into a film marked a significant moment in his career. This process was accompanied by intense emotions, including pressure and fear of failure, as well as a profound sense of responsibility to his readers. These feelings were compounded by the challenges of adapting a beloved book into a different medium.\n\n== The Adaptation Process ==\nJohn Green's experience with the adaptation of ''The Fault in Our Stars'' into a movie was multifaceted, involving both excitement and anxiety. In a video uploaded on August 27, 2013, Green expressed the dual nature of this experience.

But it is also happening because of the many people who have read and loved and shared the book so generously\" <ref name='-3H1T3xqzZY' />. This acknowledgment highlights the reciprocal relationship between author and audience, where the success of a book can lead to new opportunities, but also new pressures.\n\n== Pressure and Fear of Failure ==\nThe transition from being an author to having his work adapted into a film brought about significant personal challenges for Green. In a video from September 20, 2016, he discussed the intense pressure he felt following the success of ''The Fault in Our Stars''.

He expressed gratitude for the book's reach and the opportunities it provided, yet he also felt a deep fear of not being able to replicate its success. This fear was compounded by the realization that his identity was shifting from \"person who writes books\" to \"person who wrote that one book\" <ref name='MiX7fVkTbzM' />.

Among these are the Syrian conflict and the historical context of Boko Haram. Through his videos, Green has shared insights into the intricacies of these topics, often challenging simplistic narratives and encouraging a deeper understanding of the issues at hand.\n\n== The Complexity of the Syrian Conflict ==\nJohn Green has addressed the Syrian conflict in several of his videos, emphasizing its complexity and the challenges in finding a resolution. In his video titled \"Syria in Five Minutes,\" Green outlines the sectarian tensions and the brutal response of the Assad regime to pro-democracy protests. He notes that the conflict began with peaceful protests that were met with severe repression, leading to a violent escalation<ref name='exrqMPJ1Bts'>[Syria in Five Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exrqMPJ1Bts) - Uploaded on 2013-09-13</ref>.\n\n=== Sectarian Tensions and Political Repression ===\nGreen explains that the majority of Syrians are Sunni Muslims, while the ruling Alawite minority has historically faced repression. This sectarian divide contributed to the unrest during the Arab Spring, as the disenfranchised majority sought democratic reforms. The Assad regime's violent crackdown on protesters, including imprisonment, torture, and killings, further fueled the conflict<ref name='exrqMPJ1Bts' />. Green highlights the formation of the Free Syrian Army by defectors from the Syrian military, which added another layer of complexity to the situation<ref name='exrqMPJ1Bts' />.\n\n=== Future Governance of Syria ===\nIn another video, \"Know Your News! Understanding the Syrian Revolution in Under 4 Minutes,\" Green questions the future of Syria's governance. He discusses the challenges of achieving stability and representative government in a country with a history of coups and instability. Green poses critical questions about the international community's role in supporting the pro-democracy opposition and the potential consequences of intervention<ref name='ElRoN-uNli4'>[Know Your News!

He explains that the British colonial rule exacerbated regional disparities, with Northern Nigeria receiving less Western-style education and economic development compared to the South<ref name='WSDRF7VGmIs' />. These disparities, along with the legacies of colonialism, created fertile ground for the emergence of Boko Haram in 2002.\n\n=== Emergence of Boko Haram ===\nBoko Haram, which means \"Western education is forbidden,\" was founded by Mohammed Yusuf, who ironically had a Western-style education. Green notes that the group capitalized on the socio-economic grievances in Northern Nigeria, where poverty and lack of education were rampant<ref name='WSDRF7VGmIs' />. The group's extremist ideology and violent tactics have posed significant challenges to Nigeria's stability and security.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Arab Spring]]\n* [[Boko Haram]]\n* [[Syrian Civil War]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Vlogbrothers-related topics]]\n[[Category:Geopolitics]]",

    "13": "= Journey of Sexuality and Beliefs =\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe exploration of one's sexual orientation is often a complex and lifelong journey. This article delves into the nuanced experiences and beliefs surrounding sexuality, particularly focusing on the acknowledgment of bisexuality and the distinction between emotional love and physical attraction. The insights are drawn from a discussion featuring various perspectives on sexual identity and acceptance.\n\n== Acknowledging the Complex Journey of Sexuality ==\nThe process of understanding one's sexual orientation is described as a long and intricate journey that encompasses one's entire life. It is not a sudden realization but rather a gradual understanding of one's attractions and identity. As expressed in the discussion, \"It's a long process and it involves your entire life\" and \"It's not like one day you're just like: 'Oh, I'm gay. Huh. Hm.'\"<ref name='ZKZlIvMuLQ4'>[On Sexual Orientation, with Hannah, Ze, Tyler, and Meg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKZlIvMuLQ4) - Uploaded on 2013-04-19</ref>.\n\n== Early Identification of Attraction ==\nThe identification of attraction to women is often realized early in life.

It's not about sex,\" highlights the importance of emotional bonds.<ref name='ZKZlIvMuLQ4' /> The discussion further explores the complexities of these feelings, with one participant expressing, \"I could see myself falling in love with a man much more easily than I could see myself having sex with a man.\"<ref name='ZKZlIvMuLQ4' />\n\n== Belief in the Validity of Bisexuality ==\nThe belief that bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation is strongly affirmed. Despite societal pressures to choose one orientation, it is emphasized that \"It's not true. You can like both.\"<ref name='ZKZlIvMuLQ4' /> This belief challenges the misconception that bisexuality is merely a phase or an attention-seeking behavior.\n\n== Encouragement of Personal Acceptance ==\nAcceptance of one's personal sexuality is encouraged as a crucial step towards self-acceptance and societal acceptance. The discussion advises, \"Be comfortable and be okay just being the only person who's comfortable with your sexuality. Once you're okay with that, other people's acceptance will come.\"<ref name='ZKZlIvMuLQ4' /> This message underscores the importance of self-acceptance in the journey of understanding and embracing one's sexual identity.\n\n== See Also ==\n* [[Bisexuality]]\n* [[Sexual orientation]]\n* [[LGBT rights]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Vlogbrothers-related topics]]\n[[Category:Sexual orientation]]",
