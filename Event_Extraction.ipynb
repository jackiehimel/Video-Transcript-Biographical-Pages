Hank: Wow. John: Yeah. Just felt like giving you a hug. Hank: Uh, love a little roughhouse. John: We used to roughhouse so much\\nmore when we were in our tens. Hank: We have been making YouTube\\nvideos for hundreds of years. John: Some people say thousands! Hank: I know for a fact that I have forgotten\\nsome of the things that I have made. John: Sure. Hank: We\\'re gonna play a game today in which\\nI tell you the title of a video and you tell me\\xa0 whether it\\'s a vlogbrothers video or just\\nsomething I made up. John: My expectation is that I\\'ll get\\n100% of them correct. Hank: Okay. There\\'s a couple tricky ones. Number one. John: Yeah. Hank: “Don\\'t suck on that bone!” John: That is a vlogbrothers video title. Hank: That is correct. All right, number two! John: Number two. Hank: “The unzipped zipper.” John: That\\'s a vlogbrothers video. Hank: Yeah, it is. John: It is. I vividly remember this because\\nI gave a talk and I crushed. Everybody was\\xa0 being so attentive to me. They were listening\\nso carefully, and at the end of it, I was like,\\xa0 are there any questions? And, like 300 hands\\xa0 went up, and I was like, I\\'m a genius. And I\\ncalled on one person, and they were like,\\xa0 “are you aware that your fly is down?”\\nI turned around, I zipped my zipper up,\\xa0 and then I turned back around, and I was like,\\nare there any other questions? Silence. Hank: And that\\'s basically that whole video.\\xa0 You just watched it.\\nNumber three! “Right by chance.” John: “Right by chance” sounds like a\\nfake vlogbrothers video to me. Hank: It\\'s a fake vlogbrothers video. It\\'s a\\xa0 William Cowper quote: “A fool must now\\nand then be right, by chance.” John: All right, I\\'m gonna get 100%. Hank: Number four. “Another\\nword for ‘thesaurus’”. John: That does not sound like a\\nvlogbrothers video. Hank: It\\'s not, it\\'s a Steven Wright joke! *laughter* John: It\\'s a good title. Hank: It\\'s a good title! John: Another word for thesaurus.\\nMaybe I\\'ll do that next week. Hank: Number five, “peanut butter face\\nwhile discussing Ukraine”. John: No, surely not. That can\\'t be. No. Hank: Man, shoot! John: I couldn\\'t. Hank: The answer is no, but it\\'s a trick one,\\xa0 because you did do peanut butter face while\\ndiscussing the Georgia-Russia war! John: I did peanut butter face? This, this just\\ngoes to show you that there are eras on the\\xa0 Internet, because if I did that– I can\\'t do–\\nOh, my God, did I really do that? Hank: You did. John: Oh, my God. Hank: Number six. “My name is\\nJohn Green, and I am a nerd.” John: Yes. Vlogbrothers video. Hank: That\\'s a vlogbrothers video.\\nDang it! You are 100%. John: I\\'m gonna get 100%! Hank: All right. Number seven. John: Yeah. Hank: “February 27, 2007 - Cinnamon challenge”. John: Okay, so that\\'s not a vlogbrothers video\\nbecause we never did the cinnamon challenge. Hank: How do you know I didn\\'t do it? John: Because I\\'ve seen every one of your videos!\\nOne thing that was realistic about it is that\\xa0 we used to title our videos by the date. Hank: Yeah. John: Which, like… Hank: No, this is, this is a modified vlogbrothers\\xa0 video. The actual video was called\\n“February 27, 2007: Horseradish Challenge”. John: Horseradish challenge! Hank: Do you remember doing that? John: No, but I-I… Do you? Hank: No, I didn\\'t. John: No, I don\\'t remember doing a\\nhorseradish challenge. Hank: Yeah. John: First off, the idea that we were,\\nlike, into challenges is itself– Hank: We did– we were doing anything! John: We did everything! Hank: We were doing anything we could do. John: We’ve done everything! Hank: We\\'ve done the entire YouTube.\\nWe\\'ve done makeup tutorials. John: We\\'ve done a makeup tutorial. Hank: Yeah. John: There is not a genre, I don\\'t think,\\xa0 that– I think we\\'ve touched,\\nat least touched, every genre. Hank: I made a prank video. John: Did you? Hank: “Eyelash malaria.” John: That is a vlogbrothers video, or at least,\\nit\\'s related to a vlogbrothers video. Hank: Yeah, it’s a vlogbrothers video. John: Yeah, it\\'s about how there\\'s a drug that\\ntreats malaria that also lengthens eyelashes.\\xa0 And I made it. And I think I made it,\\nmy camera was broken. Hank: Yes! John: I made it on my computer. Hank: Yes, you made it on the iSight\\ncamera! You were so mad about it. John: I was very annoyed. Hank: I watched this one. John: That was like– Hank: Let\\'s see if I can catch you– John: Fifteen years ago. Hank: –See if I can catch you, number nine.\\n“A little learning is a dangerous thing.” John: That does not sound like\\na vlogbrothers video. Hank: Frick! It\\'s an Alexander Pope quote. *laughter* John: Pretty good title! Alexander Pope\\nknew how to clickbait on YouTube. Hank: Yeah. Frick, man, you\\'re gonna get\\nthem all, because the last one– John: Yeah. Hank: –Is “superior fish beings”. John: Oh, 100% vlogbrothers video. Hank: Definitely. John: And a classic vlogbrother video. Hank: They were all your videos. I made it easier,\\nbut I didn\\'t want to tell you that. John: SUPERIOR FISH BEINGS was yours, right? Hank: No, because I made a video\\nabout it, and then you– John: And then I replied, “superior fish beings”.\\xa0 Cause I just thought, like, the idea that you\\nthought in the future there would be superior\\xa0 fish beings? Like, that was so good, and you\\ndidn\\'t title it \"superior fish beings\"! What a thing that we\\'ve– Hank: I don\\'t want to spend too much time\\nlooking backward because then it feels like\\xa0 we, like, finished. John: Yeah, I don\\'t want to feel too\\nmuch like a nostalgia act. Hank: Yeah. John: Although, look, eventually\\nyou become a nostalgia act. Hank: It\\'s just another genre of YouTube. John: That\\'s a great point. We have to enter\\xa0 our nostalgic act genre at some point.\\nI also don\\'t want to spend too much time\\xa0 looking back. I think there\\'s lots to look\\nforward to on vlogbrothers. But we do have\\xa0 18 years of history together, and\\nthat\\'s not for nothing. Hank: John. See you now. John: And on Tuesday.'}\n"
